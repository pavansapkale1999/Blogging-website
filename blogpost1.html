        Diwali is absolutely my favorite time of year. It marks both the Hindu
        Festival of Lights and the New Year for many Hindus throughout the
        world. The multi-day celebration also symbolizes victory of good over
        evil. To signify this triumph of light over darkness in our lives, we
        light little lamps or diva in our homes. Every year, my family gathers
        and lights one divo first. Then, we use that same divo to light the
        rest. Within moments, the light from one tiny lamp has multiplied to
        illuminate many others. The room — dark just minutes ago — suddenly
        beams brightly from the collective brilliance of all the diva together.
        It is always a beautiful sight. Diwali (and the weeks of preparation
        leading up to it) is a delightful time. As a child, after weeks of
        preparing joyously, I would become sad at the end of the five-day
        festivities. I’d feel confused about how to sustain that excitement and
        warmth throughout the new year. I would be lying if I said that to this
        day, I don’t feel a tinge of that sadness at the end of Diwali. Growing
        up, my parents taught my younger brother and me that while diva visibly
        create light externally, we must also create our light internally. They
        reminded us that Diwali is an opportunity to look inwards and reflect on
        how we can sustain our inner light throughout the year. “Create light in
        your inner world,” they said, “This way, every day can become like
        Diwali.” This year, I’ve been thinking about what I can do to sustain
        the Diwali spirit. I am drawn to the image of lighting our diva one by
        one. I am mesmerized by that one original divo shining alongside the
        others, having lost none of its own radiance in giving its light to
        those around it. This ritual is a symbolic reminder of a quote that
        resonates deeply with me: “A candle loses nothing by lighting another
        candle.” Thus, this Diwali, to sustain my spirit through the year, I
        commit to lighting the candle for those around me through selflessness —
        dedicating myself to thinking of others’ needs and serving the people
        around me.
      </p>
      <p class="font1">
        It can sometimes feel like selflessness is no longer a valued trait.
        After all, we live in a self-care obsessed culture. I, too, have
        personally learned the difficult way that one cannot pour from an empty
        cup, so I appreciate the necessity of taking care of my own basic
        emotional and physical needs. Yet, research suggests that self-care and
        caring for others are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Dr. Laurie
        Santos is a leading pioneer in the field of positive psychology. A
        professor at Yale University, she teaches the university’s most popular
        course: The Science of Well-Being. Through her years of extensive
        research, Dr. Santos has learned that while prioritizing self-care is
        critical, we should expand the way we think about it:
      </p>
      <p class="font1">
        If just one week of kindness can have statistically cognizable positive
        effects on people, how much could I improve my well-being this year by
        spending it in the service of others? And, I don’t have to look too far
        to find a role model for this endeavor I am myopically thinking in terms
        of mere days and years, but my guru, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, lived his
        entire life by one simple maxim: “In the joy, happiness, and progress of
        others, lies our own.” He was the living personification of losing
        nothing by lighting others’ candles, and he did so with such ease and
        consistency. On January 26, 2001, a devastating 7.6 scale earthquake
        struck Bhuj, Gujarat, killing nearly 20,000 people, injuring over
        150,000, and upending the lives of millions more. To this day, the
        earthquake and its aftermath mark a dark moment in Gujarat’s history.
        The earthquake struck at 8:46 AM. By lunch, Pramukh Swami Maharaj had
        already arranged warm meals for the survivors, rallying thousands of
        BAPS volunteers to affected areas for relief work. But the relief work
        didn’t stop with immediate assistance; throughout the year, Pramukh
        Swami ensured that the 40,000 earthquake survivors were served warm and
        nutritious meals daily. Taking care of the smallest details, he even
        visited the kitchens. Upon meticulously inspecting the food packages, he
        advised the volunteers to place two green chilies in each packet. He
        explained that the people of the Bhuj region were accustomed to spicy
        food and that the chilies would also complement the sweets in the
        packages. Amidst the darkest times for the Kutchi people, Pramukh Swami
        Maharaj chose to be the light for thousands of strangers — strangers who
        would likely never know he did any of this. He did not stop at providing
        food packages but went above and beyond in considering how to bring even
        more light to these survivors’ days. To light another candle, Pramukh
        Swami made an effort to think about someone else’s needs and comfort
        with utmost sincerity. We might think of kindness as some grandiose
        gesture, but lighting another candle need not be extravagant; a small
        yet meaningful act of selflessness can hold immense power. Lighting
        another candle can start in my own home. I can light the candle for my
        mother by helping her with chores around the house so she can have a
        free night to herself. I can light the candle for my father by filling
        up the gas in his car, so he doesn’t need to scramble in the chaos of
        his long early morning commute. I can light the candle for my
        grandparents by video-calling so they know I’m thinking of them. Beyond
        the home, I can light the candle for a local small business by posting a
        positive review for them online. I can light the candle for an utter
        stranger by letting someone with fewer groceries ahead of me in line. I
        can light the candle for service members this holiday season by sending
        a care package to thank them for their sacrifices. In these moments of
        lighting others’ candles, I will find that my own shines brighter. In
        this way, I can maintain the spirit of Diwali throughout the whole year.
        Pramukh Swami Maharaj experienced continuous joy and peace. His flame
        never flickered, never dimmed. His life serves as inspiration and proof
        to me that we lose nothing — in fact, we only gain — by lighting another
        candle. If he could devote his entire life to the happiness of those
        around him, I can undoubtedly pledge my upcoming year to do so. And I
        hope you’ll join me too. This Diwali, as we light the diva in our homes,
        let’s also reflect on how we can light others’ candles throughout the
        year. I pray we carry the warmth of Diwali into the upcoming year by
        living for others, serving those around us, and helping others to beam
        even brighter. May we truly understand that, as Pramukh Swami Maharaj
        always knew, only in the joy of others can we find our own. From me and
        mine, to you and yours, I wish you a very happy Diwali and a joyous New
        Year!
