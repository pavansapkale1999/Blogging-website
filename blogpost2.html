        “Which kind of typewriter should I get?” The first thing I recommend to
        anyone that asks me this question is to decide between a standard or
        portable sized typewriter. I liken it to choosing between a desktop
        computer or a laptop. There are pros and cons to each. There are also
        ultra-portable (aka laptop) style typewriters worth considering, but I
        don’t own one to give you first hand knowledge on. I also think that
        either standard or portable laptops are a better machine to start with,
        especially if you’re a dedicated writer looking for a daily creative
        companion. Unlike some in the typewriter community, I am not a
        collector. Even though I am fascinated by these old machines, and I have
        played around with dozens of models I see in thrift shops, I prefer to
        only buy things that I will use. These are my tools that I use on a
        daily basis. As a result, I only have two typewriters. My goal is to
        help you choose one. While matching an Olympia SG-1 up against a Royal
        Quiet Deluxe is hardly a perfect comparison, I find that these two
        models each represent their class well. They’re both described as
        workhorses that provide pleasant typing experiences. They’re each rich
        in features for their time. And, both typewriters have avid fan bases
        that argue they are the best typewriter models ever made. However, we’re
        not here for the similarities. Let’s take a look at the differences
        between standard and portable typewriters worth considering. In
        contrast, portable typewriters can be taken anywhere, meaning that your
        typewriting experience can occur wherever you’d like. This can come at
        the expense of stability, as the lighter weight allows the machine to
        move on smooth surfaces. This is easily fixed with a good typewriter
        mat, which I recommend no matter what kind of machine you go for. Unless
        your desk height can be adjusted, portable machines often require you to
        look down at them. This can mean bad neck and back posture that over
        time can become strenuous. In the case of the Royal, “Quiet” is this
        typewriter’s middle name. It’s pretty amazing, actually. Something about
        its build, mechanics, and platen make this quiet enough that it can
        barely be heard behind a closed door. The Quiet Deluxe has more features
        than most machines, including its infamous Magic Margins, but it doesn’t
        have anywhere near the control or functionality of the SG-1. This is the
        case for most portables compared to their standard counterparts.

        In corner number one, measuring 19.5 x 16 x 8.5" (W x L x H) and
        weighing a mighty 40 pounds; it’s the pinnacle of German typewriter
        engineering, it’s the green machine, it’s… the Olympia SG1! And in
        corner number two, measuring 12.5 x 11.5 x 5.5" (W x L x H) and weighing
        a mere 12 pounds; it’s the proud American, the glass key king, it’s… the
        Royal Quiet Deluxe! The most inherent difference between standard and
        portable typewriters is their size. Standard machines are larger in both
        dimension and weight. This is important, because the size of machine you
        choose influences just about every aspect of the typing experience you
        will have on them including…
      </p>
      <p class="font1">
        Ask yourself: do you want to take your typewriter places? Even in the
        midst of a pandemic, you may find yourself wanting to take your
        typewriter to the park, outside a pub or to a coffee shop. Portable
        typewriters are more… you guessed it. Most portable typewriters like
        this Royal Quiet Deluxe are not only small enough to easily carry, they
        often come with a case. A good case makes transporting that much easier
        and it offers added protection to your typewriter. If you are a
        stationary writer, like me, a standard (aka desktop) typewriter may work
        perfectly for you. I bought the Olympia SG-1 specifically to keep on my
        desk as my go-to typewriter. All it takes is lifting this thing once to
        realize it’s not fun to move.One would think that because standard
        typewriters have more parts and cost more to make, they would cost more
        to buy. However, these are old machines that are almost always getting
        bought second hand. This means the price of a typewriter is more often
        reflected in their functionality and in how much they are desired.
        Because portable typewriters are more popular, and becoming less and
        less available, they are becoming more and more expensive. It has gotten
        to the point that just standard and portable typewriters cost about the
        same, even with some standards costing less. The other thing to consider
        is maintenance costs. Because standard typewriters are often older,
        replacing their parts can be more challenging and more expensive. Even
        with this generalization, the age of the typewriter is what effects the
        maintenance fees more than the make itself.Is one model better than the
        other? I would be hard pressed to choose between my Olympia and my
        Royal. As a standard model, the Olympia is my daily typer. I use it much
        more these days than the Royal, but the Royal was my first machine and I
        can take it anywhere. They each serve better under certain
        circumstances, which is why I decided to buy a portable and a standard
        typewriter. My goal wasn’t to tell you to buy both, though, was it? How
        about this workaround: Get a portable first, then move on to a standard
        model if you want. Portables come in a wider variety of styles, are
        easier to integrate into your daily life, and are simply fun to type on.
        At the end of the day, any typewriter is better than no typewriter.
