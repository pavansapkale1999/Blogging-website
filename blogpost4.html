      This article is about musical composition with vocals.

      A song is a musical composition performed by the human voice. The voice often carries the melody (a series of
      distinct and fixed pitches) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs have a structure to them, such as the
      common ABA form, and are usually made of sections that are repeated or performed with variation later. A song
      without instruments is said to be a cappella.

      Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a
      pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music, it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated
      pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple
      style that are learned informally "by ear" are often referred to as folk songs. Songs composed for the mass
      market, designed to be sung by professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows, are called popular
      songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and
      lyricists; art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are
      performed in studios and an audio recording is made, or they are performed "live" for audience. (In some cases a
      song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded.) Songs may also appear in theatre (e.g., opera), films and
      TV shows.
    </p>
    <p class="font1">
      A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble
      involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal
      forms including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead.[1] A song can be sung
      without accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. In popular music, a singer
      may perform with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. In jazz, a singer may
      perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. A Classical singer
      may perform with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs
      "by ear" and they may improvise some melody lines. In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet
      music format, so singers learn to read music.

      Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works. Songs can be
      broadly divided into many different forms and types, depending on the criteria used. Through semantic widening, a
      broader sense of the word "song" may refer to instrumentals, such as the 20th century Songs Without Words pieces
      for solo piano.
