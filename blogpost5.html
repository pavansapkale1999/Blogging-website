      atomic bomb, also known as a fission bomb or nuclear bomb, works based on the process of nuclear fission. The
      fundamental principle behind an atomic bomb is to release a tremendous amount of energy by splitting the nuclei of
      heavy atoms, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239.

      The basic design of an atomic bomb involves two subcritical masses of fissile material, which are kept apart to
      prevent spontaneous nuclear reactions. When the bomb is activated, conventional high explosives are used to
      rapidly compress these subcritical masses into a supercritical state.

      The detonation process can be broken down into the following steps:

      Implosion: The high explosives surrounding the fissile material are triggered, creating an intense and symmetric
      shockwave that compresses the fissile material inwards. This compression increases the density of the fissile
      material, bringing its nuclei closer together.
      Neutron Initiation: As the fissile material becomes supercritical, a significant number of neutrons are released.
      These neutrons initiate the chain reaction, which is the key to the atomic bomb’s explosive power.
      Chain Reaction: When a neutron collides with the nucleus of a fissile atom, it causes the nucleus to become
      unstable and split into two smaller nuclei, along with releasing additional neutrons. This process is known as
      nuclear fission. The released neutrons then collide with other fissile nuclei, causing them to undergo fission,
      and the chain reaction rapidly multiplies.
      Energy Release: Each fission event releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy and
      electromagnetic radiation. This energy is released almost instantaneously, resulting in a powerful explosion.
      Blast and Radiation: The explosion produces a massive shockwave and intense heat, causing widespread destruction
      in the vicinity of the blast. Additionally, the explosion releases a significant amount of ionizing radiation,
      which can be highly dangerous to living organisms and cause long-term health effects.
      The destructive power of an atomic bomb is measured in terms of its yield, which is typically expressed in
      kilotons (thousands of tons) or megatons (millions of tons) of TNT equivalent. The immense energy released in an
      atomic bomb explosion can cause devastation over a wide area and result in significant loss of life and property.

      Atomic Bomb vs Hydrogen Bomb
      The atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb (also known as a thermonuclear bomb) are both types of nuclear weapons, but they
      work on different principles and have significantly different levels of destructive power.

      The destructive power of an atomic bomb is significant, but it is relatively less than that of a hydrogen bomb.

      A hydrogen bomb is a more advanced and powerful type of nuclear weapon. It operates on the principle of nuclear
      fusion (same as our Sun), where light atomic nuclei, such as isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium), are
      fused together to form heavier nuclei like helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. As the helium atom has
      much less energy than these two isotopes combined, so, the excess energy is being released.

      The detonation process of a hydrogen bomb involves a two-stage design. The first stage is a fission bomb, similar
      to an atomic bomb, which creates the high temperature and pressure needed for fusion to occur. The second stage
      involves the fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, producing a vastly more powerful explosion than a fission bomb.

      The yield of a hydrogen bomb is typically measured in megatons (millions of tons) of TNT equivalent, making it
      several times more powerful than an atomic bomb. The first hydrogen bomb released an energy equivalent of 10
      million tons of TNT.

      Story of its Discovery
      The story of the discovery of the nuclear bomb is intertwined with the development of nuclear physics and the
      events of World War II. It involved the efforts of multiple scientists and researchers from various countries.

      The theoretical groundwork for nuclear fission — the process that powers nuclear bombs — was laid by German
      physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938. They discovered that when uranium atoms were bombarded with
      neutrons, they split into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This groundbreaking discovery
      was later explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, who coined the term “nuclear fission” and recognized its
      potential for releasing an enormous amount of energy.

      Meanwhile, a group of scientists in the United States, led by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, became aware of the
      possibility of creating an atomic bomb using nuclear fission.

      The potential for building such a weapon led to the establishment of the Manhattan Project in 1942 — a top-secret
      research program that aimed to develop an atomic bomb during World War II.

      The Manhattan Project brought together some of the greatest scientific minds of the time, including Enrico Fermi,
      Richard Feynman, and Niels Bohr, among others. The project involved extensive research and development efforts
      across multiple locations, with key facilities in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

      On July 16, 1945, the first successful test of an atomic bomb, code-named “Trinity,” took place in the desert near
      Alamogordo, New Mexico. The test was a success, proving the feasibility of the atomic bomb design and validating
      the scientific theories behind nuclear fission.

      A few weeks later, on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb named “Little Boy” on the Japanese
      city of Hiroshima which released an energy equivalent to 15000 tons of TNT. The devastation caused by the bomb was
      immense, leading to significant loss of life and destruction of the city.

      Three days later, on August 9, 1945, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb, “Fat Man,” on the city of
      Nagasaki. The use of these two atomic bombs marked the first and, to date, the only use of nuclear weapons in
      warfare.

      “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I
      remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he
      should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‘Now I am become Death, the
      destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.”

      ― J. Robert Oppenheimer

    <p class="font1">
      The use of atomic bombs is a subject of great concern due to their devastating effects, and they have been used
      only twice in warfare: in 1945, during World War II, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese
      cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

      The use of nuclear weapons is now heavily regulated by international treaties to prevent their proliferation and
      to promote global security.
