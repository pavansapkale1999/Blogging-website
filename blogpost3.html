      This atmosphere filled with torrents of grief and adulation might not be the most conducive for a dispassionate
      analysis on A.P.J.Abdul Kalam. This short piece was prompted by a few questions that a dear friend asked me
      sometime back — “Don’t you feel sad at his passing? Weren’t you shocked?” My answer to both these questions was
      No. For a minute, I felt like Meursault, the protagonist of Camus’s ‘Outsider’, who did not feel any grief after
      his mother’s death — a lack of feeling which led the society and the judiciary to condemn him to the gallows.
      If someone had asked me these same questions 10–15 years back, my reaction would have been somewhere near the
      diametric opposite. That was around the time ‘Wings of fire’ occupied pride of place in my bookshelf and Kalam’s
      speeches asking children and youth to “dream” was the source of all inspiration. That was also the time when
      nuclear scientists and men of war occupied exalted pantheons in my mind.

      A few years down the line, much into his Presidency, I happened to read a ‘Frontline’ article written just before
      he took over as President. That one article sowed elements of doubt about the man. Then, his appearances on stage
      with the likes of Mata Amritanandamayi raised questions on his scientific temper. Some ounces of respect remained,
      which flowed away after seeing his stand on the Koodankulam issue. Like a true technocrat, he claimed the plant to
      be 100 percent safe and went to the extent of branding those who stood against it as anti-national. He also
      championed the idea of river-linking, a disastrous unscientific project which every well meaning water
      conservationist in the country has trashed.

      In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
      to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
      gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
      communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
      medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a
      person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or
      felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
      distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present
      when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted
      spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication
      across space and time. The process of encoding converts information from
      a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the
      reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the
      recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for
      coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain
      language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example,
      semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the
      arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically
      individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance
      away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.

      “The unqualified exaltation of strategic strength, together with economic power, as the essence of the meaning of
      the terms independence and freedom is an essential element of Kalam’s world-view.

      Kalam, unlike some other pro-nuclear weapons scientists and strategic analysts, has never acknowledged, even after
      he ceased to be in government, that the lobbying by scientists in favour of exercising the nuclear option amounted
      to an attempt to force a change in an existing policy line, a change that many successive governments were
      unwilling to undertake. But the remarks quoted above, together with his one-sided playing up of the scientists’
      mandate to undertake purely technical development of various aspects of nuclear weapons, suggest that his own
      personal views were clearly at odds with several basic features of India’s long-standing nuclear policy, including
      the Nehruvian vision that had provided its basic framework.

      Clearly, Kalam’s viewpoint is more in tune with, and provides support to, the jingoistic agenda of the
      ideological-political formation whose political arm is the BJP. In this light, the choice of Abdul Kalam as its
      Presidential candidate and the immediate welcome that it received from organisations such as the Rashtriya
      Swayamsevak Sangh, the Shiv Sena and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad is unsurprising. One may add here that on the part
      of the Congress party its well-known hesitation to take a firm stand against the nuclear weaponisation programme
      of the BJP-led government and its reluctance on occasion to confront ultra-nationalist tendencies have also
      contributed in some measure to its eventual support to Abdul Kalam’s candidature.

      Hawkish viewpoints, such as Kalam’s, typically make little or no attempt to respond seriously to those who are
      genuinely concerned about nuclear weaponisation and are opposed to it politically. In a rare public outburst
      following the anti-nuclear weapons protests throughout the country on August 8, 1998, Kalam berated the
      protestors: “These so-called intellectuals… should have held demonstrations in Washington and Moscow to put
      pressure on those governments. Once those countries become zero-level [in the number of warheads], then everyone
      becomes zero-level” (The Times of India, August 9, 1998).

      This essentially technocratic and hawkish vision of nuclear and strategic issues that has little input from an
      understanding of the nuances of history or politics appears to carry over to other aspects of Kalam’s thinking.

      DEVELOPMENT has been, in Kalam’s words, his ‘second great vision for India’, and the book, India 2020: Vision for
      the New Millennium, that he co-authored with Y.S. Rajan is a detailed exploration of the subject in the Kalam
      style. A striking feature of the book is its virtual refusal to engage with the problem of social and economic
      inequalities in any depth. In the case of prospective incumbents of Rashtrapathi Bhavan who have a record of
      political activity, one may discern the broad contours of their opinion on the central questions of caste, class
      and gender in Indian society from their general political affiliation and record. But in the case of
      technologist-administrator, particularly those from the strategic sector like Kalam, who have a strong tradition
      of remaining silent in public on such issues while in government service and who often lay claim to a totally
      apolitical role in Indian society, it is surely a matter of general concern that their views on the most important
      social and political questions of Indian society are known to some degree. Kalam’s book, on the contrary, is
      steadfastly apolitical in this sense.
      The central idea in Kalam’s vision is that all that development requires, apart from technical planning, is a
      gigantic summoning up of national faith and will, a kind of collective heave-ho to get our society moving, that
      would, within the space of 20 years, transform India into a developed nation. “

    </p>
    <p class="font1">
      “It was at Kalam’s first press conference on June 19, after he filed his nomination papers, that the politician in
      him came to the fore. The media were agog and many newspersons were eager to speak to the first-ever
      scientist-technologist who would be President; it was not unlikely, it appeared, that he would make some unguarded
      remarks, considering his relative naivety in political terms. But Kalam disappointed them all. He fielded
      questions with the deftness of a politician, and like a seasoned politician he stuck to a few politically correct,
      well-rehearsed lines, even in the face of persistent, uncomfortable questioning on Gujarat, India-Pakistan ties,
      Ayodhya and even his own initial reluctance to accept the candidature. He ducked questions he did not want to
      reply to by promptly moving on to the next questioner. He ultimately succeeded in managing the media to his
      advantage, and by the time he finished it seemed he had them eating out of his hand.

      It was clear from the beginning that it would be Kalam who would run the show, and not Pramod Mahajan, who tried
      prompting him. He soon forced the media to fall in line: he insisted that he would first jot down the questions
      and then reply to them one by one, and he stuck to this mode for the first few minutes despite much protest.
      Questions on Gujarat had him reeling out homilies on the elevation of religion to spiritualism and the development
      of leadership with compassion. In his world view, problems of communalism can be solved if there is total
      literacy, education and health for all, agricultural development and food processing. He also insisted that
      problems such as Ayodhya can be solved with the same formula. No amount of prodding would make him comment on the
      acts of commission or omission by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi or the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
      government.”


      I recently went back to check some of his speeches and found that he has been saying the same things for the past
      two decades — asking children to dream. That old copy of ‘Wings of fire’ is still there in my bookshelf, not
      occupying pride of place, but sitting along with other uninspiring reads like ‘World is flat’.

      Kalam comes across as well-meaning individual, who is pretty shallow in his world view. And, no, I dont feel even
      a tinge of sadness. Hope I won’t be hanged for saying this.
